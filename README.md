# SVAT Model

This repository contains a simplified Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model developed for estimating evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture levels. The model integrates an aerodynamic and surface resistance calculation framework along with a canopy water balance module to estimate ET and soil moisture.

This model simulates ET components and soil moisture for forest and grassland canopies as a course requirement for the Quantitative Ecohydrology class (CIVE 625) at CSU Fort Collins. Other canopy trypes can be modeled by changing the "ForestConstants" class.
