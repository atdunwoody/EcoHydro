# SVAT Model README

This repository contains a simplified Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model developed for estimating evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture levels. The model integrates an aerodynamic and surface resistance calculation framework along with a canopy water balance module to estimate ET accurately. Additionally, it features a straightforward soil moisture update module.

Designed as a course requirement for the Quantitative Ecohydrology class (CIVE 625), this model is specifically tailored to simulate ET components and soil moisture for forest and grassland canopies. At this stage, the model's capabilities are focused on these two canopy types, offering insights into their respective water usage and soil moisture dynamics.
